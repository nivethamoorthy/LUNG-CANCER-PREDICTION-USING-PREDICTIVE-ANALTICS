## LUNG-CANCER-PREDICTION-USING-PREDICTIVE-ANALYTICS
   This project is to predict the lung cancer using Machine Learning

### Problem Statement 
  This model is designed for predicting lung cancer using textual data. Textual data in the sense ,we investigated about sex, age , smoking habit ,alcohol consumption, allergy , wheezing, chronic disease , fatigue , yellow finger , chest pain etc. This model will predict the lung cancer based on accuracy.
       In existing system ,lung cancer prediction was found out by the Chest X-Ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and  computed tomography(CT) scans, PET(positron emission Tomography).This scan can sometimes detect disease before it shows up on other imaging tests and Bronchoscopy  etc., by the health profession.
       
### Abstract
   Lung Cancer is known to be the most highest killer among all type of cancers such as Skin Cancer,Breast Cancer etc. Lung Cancer is also called as Lung Carcinoma, which is a Malignant Tumor described by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the Lung . To prevent lung cancer deaths,high risk individuals are screened with low-dose CT scans,because early prediction will double the survival rate of the cancer patients. Usually Lung Cancer is predicted by using MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging)scans and CT ( Computer Tomography) scans. We proposed a new model to predict Lung Cancer by using textual data. In particular, we investigated about sex,age,Smoking habit,Alcohol consumption,continuous Coughing, Wheezing trouble etc,. In this work,we use Supervised Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to predict Lung Cancer in terms of accuracy. Aim of our project is to build a model for early prediction of the Lung Cancer which will help the doctor in saving the life of patients.

### Data collection
Data is collected from various sources. The dataset is collected for lung cancer based on fields such as gender, smoking habit,wheezing, alchocol consumption etc.,

### Data preparation
Here data is cleaned, removed unwanted fields, and replace missing values.

### Apply model
Comparison between algorithms is done and found out the accuracy between various algorithms.
The comparison is done between various supervised learning algorithms such as naive bayes,linear regression etc.,

### Training model
The best two algorithm is taken based on its high accuracy rate and less running time. The model is trained with training data.

### Model evaluation and testing module
After training the model is tested with remaining data.

### Predictive analytics
The real time data is collected and fed into the model that helps to find out the effectiveness of the model built.
